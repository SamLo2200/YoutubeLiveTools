## Youtube Livestream Toolkits

This website aims to provide a complete set of tools for viewers and live streamers to audience-watching experience. Currently, this project is targeting [米亞 (Mya)](https://www.youtube.com/@%E7%B1%B3%E4%BA%9E), a Hong Kong Vtuber passionate about music creation.

Todos:

-   A tool to generate timestamps

-   A .txt parser to parse past timestamps file I have created for Mya

-   A search interface for Mya viewers to search past timestamps and songs covered in singing live streams with a public API

-   A livestream looper that can loop between timestamps ([Similar to the console plugin I made before](https://github.com/SamLo2200/youtube-player-timestamp-display-console-plugin) )

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
